# SEM-nuclear-renewables
input data, model code, output for nuclear vs. renewables analysis

models

  - SEM-1.1-const-nuc: constant nuclear generation

  - SEM-1.1-flex-nuc: flexible nuclear generation (no curtailed generation from nuclear)

  - input data (solar and wind capacity factors, demand) are in directory of each model

results (will upload to Zenodo upon publication; Zenodo uploads require publication details)
